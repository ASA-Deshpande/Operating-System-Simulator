Time Slice Concept implementation doubt.

1) Supervisory Storage - Queues of

- queue of character arrays.
- queue of vector of chars of size of 40.
- ebq of size 10 at the start.

2) Auxiliary Storage - 

- 50 blocks of memory.

- 0 - 9 blocks - program cards.
- 10 - 19 block - data cards.
- 20 - 29 blocks - ofbq data.

Andy:
1] Init function
2] Division of cpu n mmry class
3] error and hread [continue till next amj in errorprone jobs]
4] handle aux memory overflow


// 1) CPU Status for every process needs to be remembered and stored somewhere so
// that when new process enters we are able to remember the previous state condition of the CPU.

// 2) Memory Class to be defined separately.

// Was thinking for creating 3 different methods for channels. Like StartChannel1, startChannel2, startChannel3.
